Here are the coding test instructions below. 

Given an amount in Bills that can be (1,2,5,10,20,50,100) change it to coins that are (0.01,0.05,0.10,0.25). The machine needs to assume there is a finite number of coins. 

Assumptions: 

Requirements:
- Start with 100 coins of each type (BONUS* - allow for number of coins to be configurable and easily changed if needed)
- Prompt User for an amount they want to get change for. (BONUS* -  allow for direct rest service inputs as an alternative as well)

-- Catch bad input and display error messages or catch exceptions if applicable
-- Machine should return the least amount of coins possible (BONUS * - Allow for other routines like most amount of coins)
-- Machine should display a message if it does not have enough coins
-- Code should maintain the state of coins left throughout all the transaction till it runs out of the coin then it should exit.

 Take into account Object oriented aspects and think about code evolution and different requirements.

- Deliver the code with test cases
- Write it in java and upload to GitHub. Send the repo URL back to us as soon as possible.
- Come to interview prepared to walk through code
-
Make sure to bring laptop with code to the interview as we will ask the candidate to change things based on different requirements.
